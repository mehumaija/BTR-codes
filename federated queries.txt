FEDERATED QUERIES, WHY NOT WORKING???





UNIPROT

// does not work, gives error
//getting the uniprot page of a KEGG Gene, translating it into string and into an URL
PREFIX kegg: <http://bio2rdf.org/kegg_vocabulary:>

WHERE {
SERVICE <https://bio2rdf.org/sparql> {
    ?gene kegg:x-uniprot ?resource.
    BIND(STR(?resource) as ?resourceString)
    BIND(IRI(?resourceString) as ?resourceIri)
    }
} limit 10








NEXTPROT



// keeps on running, but if "?iso :swissprotPage ?swiri." is removed, gives results nice and fast.
// ?swiri is the same form than what is got with ?iso :swissprotPage, the table even shows the link in the form of uniprot:XXXXX instead of the whole URL

BIO2RDF


// trying string url conversions. this works without the federation "SERVICE <https://api.nextprot.org/sparql> {?iso :swissprotPage ?swiri.}" with it, gives 504 Gateway Time-out
// taking the uniprot page of KEGG Gene, taking its Uniprot identifier (not necessary), replacing it into a String of URL and that into a real URL
// ^^ ?UPiri is exactly the same than ?resource
// takig the Uniprot URL String and replacing that with the Uniprot URL String appropriate in Nextprot and translating that into URL
